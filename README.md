We are introducing an algorithm that forecasts soil moisture behavior. Our approach involves formulating a soil moisture model based on water balance and a two-stage optimization-based estimation strategy. Our case study involves a commercial sweetcorn field using surface irrigation in South Florida. 

This algorithm is a supplementary resource for our upcoming paper, providing complete mathematical formulations and detailed results.
